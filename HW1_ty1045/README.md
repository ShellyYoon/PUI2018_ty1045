# Environment Variable Set Up

To complete this part of the HW1, I am using the CUSP ADRF.
Firstly, make a new directory called PUI2018 in my home directory by doing
```bash
mkdir PUI2018
```
To set up an environment variable, open up the .bashrc file and add two lines at the end of the file.
```bash
export PUI2018="~/PUI2018"
alias pui2018="cd $PUI2018"
```

To test that the environment variable has been successfully set up, type in commands and get the following results

Therefore, the environment variable has been successfully set.
